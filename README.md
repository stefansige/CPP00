# Cpp00 - Introduction to C++

## Description
This repository contains my solutions for the Cpp00 project from School 42. Cpp00 is designed to introduce students to the fundamentals of C++ programming language.

## Project Structure
# Exercise 00: Megaphone
This program amplifies input text to uppercase, ensuring everyone is wide awake with its loud output.

# Exercise 01: My Awesome PhoneBook
Transport back to the 80s with this retro-awesome phonebook software. Manage contacts and perform basic operations like adding and searching.

# Exercise 02: The Job Of Your Dreams
Recreate a lost file, `Account.cpp`, based on available resources including `Account.hpp` and a log file. Show off your C++ skills and impress your colleagues!

Each exercise folder contains the source code files required to complete the tasks.

## Getting Started
To compile and run the code:
1. Navigate to the desired exercise folder (e.g., `ex00`).
2. Run the `Makefile` using the `make` command.
3. Execute the compiled program.
