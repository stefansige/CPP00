# Cpp00 - Introduction to C++

## Description
This repository contains my solutions for the Cpp00 project from School 42. Cpp00 is designed to introduce students to the fundamentals of C++ programming language.

## Project Structure
- **ex00**: Introduction to C++ Basics
- **ex01**: Introduction to C++ Memory Management
- **ex02**: Introduction to C++ Object-Oriented Programming

Each exercise folder contains the source code files required to complete the tasks.

## Getting Started
To compile and run the code:
1. Navigate to the desired exercise folder (e.g., `ex00`).
2. Run the `Makefile` using the `make` command.
3. Execute the compiled program.
